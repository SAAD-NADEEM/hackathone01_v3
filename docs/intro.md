# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This comprehensive educational resource is designed for graduate-level engineering students studying Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The content is organized into four modules, each building upon the previous to provide a complete understanding of the field from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

## Course Structure

This 13-week curriculum is organized into 4 modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - 5 weeks
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - 2 weeks
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - 3 weeks
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - 3 weeks

Each module includes multiple chapters with learning objectives, prerequisites, core concepts, implementation examples, exercises, and summaries.

## What You'll Learn

- Robotic operating systems and middleware (ROS 2)
- Simulation environments and digital twins
- AI frameworks for robotics
- Vision-language-action models for robot control
- Integration of all components in a capstone project

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming skills (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with control systems concepts
- Basic knowledge of robotics principles

## How to Use This Resource

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
- Learning objectives (measurable outcomes)
- Prerequisites (knowledge required)
- Core concepts (theoretical foundation)
- Implementation (practical application)
- Examples (real-world scenarios)
- Summary (key takeaways)
- Exercises (3 per chapter: logical, conceptual, implementation)

Begin with Module 1 and progress sequentially through the modules. Complete all exercises in each chapter before moving to the next.
