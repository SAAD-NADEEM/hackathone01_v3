# Capstone Project: Integrated Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics System

## Overview

The capstone project integrates all four modules of the curriculum into a comprehensive Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics system. This project demonstrates the synthesis of ROS 2, Digital Twins, AI-Brains, and Vision-Language-Action capabilities.

## Project Objectives

Students will design and implement a complete robotic system that:
1. Operates using ROS 2 middleware for component communication
2. Utilizes digital twin simulation for development and validation
3. Incorporates AI-based perception, planning, and control
4. Responds to natural language commands through VLA integration
5. Demonstrates sophisticated manipulation and navigation capabilities

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed all four modules:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Project Requirements

### System Architecture
The final system must include:
- A communication layer using ROS 2
- Simulation environment (Gazebo/Unity) with real-world counterpart
- AI perception and decision-making modules
- Vision-Language-Action integration for natural interaction

### Functional Requirements
1. **Navigation**: The robot must autonomously navigate to specified locations
2. **Manipulation**: The robot must manipulate objects based on high-level commands
3. **Perception**: The robot must recognize and classify objects in its environment
4. **Interaction**: The robot must respond to natural language commands
5. **Safety**: The system must operate safely in human-populated environments

### Technical Requirements
1. All code must follow established coding standards with proper documentation
2. The system must be validated in both simulation and real-world environments
3. Performance metrics must be established and measured
4. All mathematical expressions must be validated
5. All code examples must include both WHAT and WHY explanations
