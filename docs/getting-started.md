# Getting Started

Welcome to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics educational resource! This guide will help you get started with the curriculum and make the most of this comprehensive learning platform.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this course, ensure you have:

- Basic programming skills in Python
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with computer networks and operating systems
- Basic knowledge of control systems concepts
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software

## Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into four progressive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - 5 weeks
- Focuses on the Robot Operating System (ROS 2)
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and messaging
- Implement communication between robotic components

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - 2 weeks
- Explore simulation environments for robotics
- Create virtual robots and environments
- Test algorithms in safe, controlled conditions

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - 3 weeks
- Develop artificial intelligence for robotic systems
- Implement perception and decision-making algorithms
- Integrate AI models with robotic platforms

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - 3 weeks
- Combine vision, language, and action for advanced robotics
- Learn about multimodal AI systems
- Implement human-robot interaction capabilities

## How to Navigate This Resource

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Learning Objectives**: What you'll be able to do after completing the chapter
2. **Prerequisites**: Knowledge required before starting the chapter
3. **Core Concepts**: Theoretical foundation and key principles
4. **Implementation**: Practical application and coding examples
5. **Examples**: Real-world scenarios and use cases
6. **Summary**: Key takeaways and important points
7. **Exercises**: Three types of exercises per chapter:
   - Logical: Conceptual problems requiring reasoning
   - Conceptual: Understanding of principles and frameworks
   - Implementation: Hands-on coding or simulation exercises

## Mathematical Notation

This resource uses consistent mathematical notation throughout. Refer to the [Notation](./notation.md) page for definitions of all symbols and operators used.

## Technical Terms

Robotics and AI involve many specialized terms. The [Glossary](./glossary.md) provides definitions for all technical terminology used in this curriculum.

## Development Environment

For hands-on exercises and implementation, you'll need:

- A computer with sufficient processing power for simulation
- ROS 2 installation (covered in Module 1)
- Simulation software (Gazebo/Unity - covered in Module 2)
- NVIDIA Isaac™ development tools (covered in Module 3)
- Python and C++ development environments

## Getting Help

If you encounter difficulties:

- Review the prerequisites for each chapter to ensure you have the required background
- Use the built-in search to find related concepts
- Work through the exercises to reinforce your understanding
- Consult the additional resources and references provided

## Capstone Project

The course culminates in a [Capstone Project](./capstone-project.md) that integrates all four modules. This project demonstrates your ability to synthesize knowledge from the entire curriculum into a comprehensive robotic system.

## Next Steps

Start with Module 1, beginning with the introduction to understand the foundational concepts. Progress through each chapter sequentially, completing all exercises before moving to the next. This approach ensures you build a solid foundation before tackling more complex topics.
