# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Digital twins provide virtual representations of physical robotic systems, enabling simulation, testing, and development without requiring access to physical hardware. This module explores Gazebo and Unity as platforms for creating sophisticated robotic simulations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Design and implement robot models for simulation
2. Configure physics properties and environments in Gazebo
3. Create realistic simulation scenarios in Unity
4. Integrate simulated robots with ROS 2
5. Validate robotic algorithms in virtual environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Knowledge of physics simulation principles
- Experience with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Module Structure

This module contains 2 chapters covering:

1. **Chapter 6**: Introduction to Gazebo Simulation
2. **Chapter 7**: Unity for Robotics Applications

## Summary

Digital twin technology enables safe, cost-effective development and testing of robotics applications. By mastering Gazebo and Unity, students gain powerful tools for creating and validating robotic systems in virtual environments.
