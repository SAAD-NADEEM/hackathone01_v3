# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 1 of our comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "nervous system" of robotic platforms. ROS 2 provides the middleware infrastructure for communication, coordination, and management of robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
2. Develop and deploy ROS 2 nodes for robotic applications
3. Implement communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
4. Configure and launch complex robotic systems
5. Integrate hardware interfaces and sensors with ROS 2

## Prerequisites
Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python and/or C++ programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Knowledge of fundamental robotics concepts (kinematics, dynamics)

## Module Structure
This module is divided into 5 chapters, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2:

1. **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Architecture
2. **Chapter 2**: Nodes, Packages, and Workspaces
3. **Chapter 3**: Communication Patterns (Topics, Services, Actions)
4. **Chapter 4**: Launch Systems and Parameter Management
5. **Chapter 5**: Hardware Integration and Device Drivers

## About ROS 2
ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robotic software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robotic behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. Unlike traditional frameworks, ROS 2 is designed to work well in distributed systems and can run on a variety of platforms from embedded systems to cloud computing.

ROS 2 provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. It provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and a package system to manage the code.

## Getting Started
To begin with this module, you'll need to install ROS 2. We recommend using the latest long-term support (LTS) distribution. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

In the next chapter, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture, including the differences from ROS 1 and the improvements made in the latest versions.
