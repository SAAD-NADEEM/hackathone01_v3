# Docusaurus-based Technical Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This repository contains a comprehensive educational resource book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, structured as a 13-week postgraduate curriculum. The book is built using Docusaurus and deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Overview

The curriculum is organized into 4 core modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Weeks 1-5
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Weeks 6-7
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Weeks 8-10
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Weeks 11-13

The book follows constitutional principles including mathematical validation, code example testing, proper citations in APA format, and structured learning pathways.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (version 20.x or higher)
